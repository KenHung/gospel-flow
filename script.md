# 詳細步驟
標題係你需要講嘅內容，然後係預期嘅答案同指導。記住，一定要等人答到啱嘅答案先可以繼續問下一條問題。

## 開場白

### Hello，我想問你一條問題。
好啊，你問啦…

### 1. 你覺得人死咗之後會點？
唔知喎。
* 如果佢講咗輪迴或者其他理論，通常最好直接問下一條問題，唔好喺呢度糾纏，免得一開頭就冒犯對方。
* 如果佢講天堂同地獄，就問佢覺得自己會唔會去天堂，同點解。然後跳過問題 2。如果佢話：「因為耶穌係為我嘅罪死。」就問佢：「根據你過去嘅生活，你覺得你應該去天堂定地獄？」如果佢答「天堂」，就去問題 4；如果佢答「地獄」，就去問題 17。

### 2. 你信唔信有神？
信。
* 如果佢話唔信，就問：「你覺得我而家身處嘅呢間屋，係有人起，定係自己出現嘅？」【等佢答】
「呢間屋證明緊佢有一個建築師。同樣道理，當我哋睇到宇宙嘅時候，我哋就知宇宙有個開始，所以一定有個創造者創造佢。宇宙就係有創造者嘅證據。屋需要建築師，萬物需要創造者，你同唔同意？」

> [!NOTE]
> 如果佢唔信有神或者創造者，之後嘅問題對佢嚟講可能無咩意思，所以要繼續直至佢信。但如果佢仲係唔信，就跳去問題 5。如果佢完全唔配合，就同佢講你係想同佢分享耶穌嘅好消息，教佢點樣避免地獄嘅懲罰，然後祝佢好運，最後畀個社交媒體連結佢，有需要就自己再搵返你。

## 好人測試 - 使人知罪

### 3. 既然我哋知有神，同我哋點樣生活就好有關係。你覺得自己係咪一個好人？
係啊。
* 如果佢話唔係，可以多謝佢嘅坦白，然後解釋我哋所有人都做過錯嘅嘢——舉例：講大話、攞咗唔屬於自己嘅嘢、發脾氣、講粗口。之後再去問題 7。

### 4. 你有冇講過大話？
有啊。
* 如果佢話冇，你可以話：「咁你而家可能就係講緊大話囉，因為每個人都講過大話嘅。」

### 5. 你有冇講過粗口？
有啊。

### 6. 你有冇發過脾氣或者用言語傷害過人？
有啊。

> [!NOTE]
> 繼續之前，一定要佢對問題 4、5 或 6至少有一個答「有」。如果佢堅持話「冇」，就問佢有冇得罪過神。如果佢答「有」，就可以繼續問。如果仲係話「冇」，你可以話：「《羅馬書》3:23 話：『因為世人都犯了罪，虧缺了神的榮耀。』你同唔同意自己喺神面前係一個罪人？如果答「係」，就繼續問。如果佢仲係話「唔係」，你可以話佢啱啱犯咗驕傲嘅罪，睇下佢會唔會因此謙卑啲。如果仲係唔得，因為佢唔想認真傾，你就祝佢好運，然後畀社交媒體連結佢。

> [!TIP]
> 如果對方比較年輕，地獄gag都可以係一個例子。

### 7. 我哋都做過呢啲嘢，如果神根據呢啲嘢嚟審判你，你覺得你係無罪定有罪？
有罪。
* 如果佢話無罪，畀個定義佢聽：「無罪嘅意思係你一生都冇做過任何錯事；有罪嘅意思係你至少做過一件錯事。咁你係邊個？」

有啲人喺呢一條問題或者下一條問題會嘗試搵藉口，比如話：「但我會祈禱求原諒。」或者「但神係會原諒人嘅。」或者「但我而家努力變好咗。」你可以用法庭嘅比喻回應，或者簡單啲講：「但我哋仍然對我哋做過嘅錯事有罪，所以……」（進入下一條問題）。

### 8. 咁你覺得應該會有獎賞定懲罰？
懲罰。
* 如果佢話獎賞（有啲人會咁答），問佢：「如果我亂過馬路，警察會畀我一束花，定係畀我一張罰單？」
* 如果佢仲話獎賞，進一步問：「咁有邊個國家會因為亂過馬路送花畀你嘅？」

### 9. 咁你覺得呢個地方係天堂定地獄？
地獄。
* 如果佢話天堂，問佢：「天堂聽起嚟似懲罰咩？定係其實係地獄？」你都可以問佢：「法官會唔會將一個罪犯送去迪士尼，定係送去監獄？」

## 福音

### 10. 咁你覺得點樣先至可以避免去地獄？
唔知喎。
* 如果佢話做好事：「想像下，如果你今日犯咗5個嚴重嘅罪行，第二日你停止犯罪，仲做好10件好事，咁警察會唔會追究你犯嘅罪？」
  * 「啱啦，同樣道理，停止犯罪同做好事都唔會抹去我哋做過嘅錯事，我哋仍然應該接受懲罰，亦即係地獄。」
* 如果佢話祈求原諒：「想像下，你犯咗一條社會上好嚴重嘅法例，站喺法官面前祈求原諒，咁法官會唔會放你走？」【等佢答】
  * 「啱啦，同樣道理，向神祈求原諒都唔會抹去我哋違反祂律法嘅懲罰。祈求原諒係值得做嘅事，但唔會支付我哋嘅地獄罰款。」
* 如果佢話悔改，問佢悔改嘅意思。如果佢話：「祈求原諒」，就參考上面嘅比喻。好多人會以為悔改就係祈求原諒，你需要解釋悔改係改變心意，由唔信基督變成相信基督，而祈求原諒同遠離罪惡係悔改嘅「結果」。

### 11. 我哋需要有人替我哋承受懲罰。如果有人替你承受100%地獄嘅懲罰，你仲使唔使罰？
冇咗喇。
* 如果佢仲係好難講出「冇」或者「零」，問佢：「如果有人幫你剁咗所有手指，你仲剩幾多隻手指？」然後重複問題。

### 12. 咁如果你冇哂地獄嘅懲罰，你死咗之後會去邊？
天堂。
* 如果佢仲話地獄，問佢懲罰點樣處理咗。（係有人替我哋承受）
* 如果佢仲係唔明，可以用超速罰單嘅例子：「想像下，你有張1000蚊嘅罰款單，然後有人幫你全數支付咗，冇收你一蚊。咁你仲要畀幾多錢？」（零）
  * 「同樣道理，我哋應該去地獄，呢個係我哋罪嘅刑罰，但如果耶穌幫我哋承擔咗100%嘅刑罰，咁就唔會有剩低嘅刑罰。所以我哋會去邊？點解？」

### 13. 呢個就係耶穌嚟到世界，死喺十字架上嘅原因，為咗承擔我哋罪嘅懲罰，三日之後從死裡復活。
### 14. 如果耶穌替你承擔咗刑罰，你死後會去邊？
天堂。
* 如果佢仲話地獄，重複問題：「如果耶穌替你承擔所有地獄嘅懲罰，你仲使唔使罰？」...唔使。然後再重複問問題 14。

### 15. 咁點解神會畀你上天堂？
因為耶穌幫我嘅罪付咗代價。
* 如果佢仲以為係因為自己嘅行為，就返去問題 10。

### 16. 神將呢樣嘢作為一個禮物免費俾我哋，而我哋只需要相信耶穌死喺十字架上，替我哋承受100%地獄嘅懲罰。
### 17. 如果你今日相信耶穌已經為你所有嘅罪負上代價，第二日又犯咗5件罪，然後死咗，你會去天堂定地獄？
天堂。
* 如果佢話地獄，問佢：「咁係咩令你可以入天堂㗎？」...耶穌。
「咁耶穌係替你承受你過去嘅罪，定係包括未來嘅罪？」...未來。然後再重複初頭嘅問題。

* 如果佢話只係幫過去嘅罪，你可以話：「如果耶穌替你承受100%罪嘅後果，咁一定包括你未來嘅罪，係唔係呀？」

### 18. 咁點解你可以去天堂？
因為耶穌幫我嘅罪付上代價。
* 如果佢仲以為係因為自己做咗好事，或者因為祈求原諒，就返去問問題 10。

### 冇錯，你的確會去天堂，因為耶穌替你承擔咗你過去、現在同埋未來嘅罪。

### 19. 如果你唔相信耶穌替你承擔你嘅罪，咁你會去邊？
地獄。
* 如果佢話天堂，問佢：「如果我而家送一份禮物俾你，但你唔接受，你係咪真係得到呢份禮物呀？」...唔係。
「同樣道理，耶穌提供咗一份禮物，替你承擔你嘅罪，但如果你唔接受，就攞唔到。所以你會去邊？」

### 20. 咁如果你唔想去地獄，你覺得應該幾時相信耶穌替你承擔你嘅罪？
而家！
* 如果佢話「死之前」，問佢：「咁你知唔知自己幾時會死呀？如果唔知，咁係咪應該而家就開始相信？」

### 21. 假設你而家站喺神面前，神問你：「點解我要畀你入天堂？」你會點答？
因為耶穌幫我嘅罪付咗代價。
* 如果佢話「我唔知」，問佢：「咁頭先講過係咩原因令你可以入天堂㗎？」如果佢答啱，就返去再問問題 21。
* 如果佢嘅答案以「因為我接受」或者「因為我相信」開頭，問佢：「我哋入天堂係因為我哋為神做咗啲咩，定係因為神為我哋做咗啲咩？」...係因為神為我哋做。
「啱啦，所以如果我哋嘅答案係用第一人稱開始，即係『因為我…』，咁其實就係想講我哋自己做過嘅嘢，而唔係耶穌為我哋做過嘅嘢。明唔明呀？咁你會點樣重新答呢條問題？」
* 如果佢話「兩樣都有」（即係神做咗同我哋自己都有做），問佢：「咁係神做咗100%，定係你哋兩個一人一半？」...神做咗100%。
「啱啦，所以我哋嘅答案唔應該係『因為我…』，而係用第三人稱講『因為耶穌…』。咁你會點樣重新答神嘅問題呀？」
* 如果佢想要聖經經文支持，可以用《馬太福音》7:22-23：「當那日必有許多人對我說：『主啊，主啊，我們不是奉你的名傳道，奉你的名趕鬼，奉你的名行許多異能嗎？』我就明明地告訴他們說：『我從來不認識你們，你們這些作惡的人，離開我去吧！』」

22. 假設有個朋友同你講佢會去天堂，因為佢係個好人。咁你覺得佢死咗會去邊？
地獄。
如果佢話天堂，問佢：「咁神會因為咩原因畀人去天堂㗎？」...耶穌。
「啱啦，所以你嘅朋友係相信耶穌帶佢去天堂，定係相信自己嘅行為？」...相信自己嘅行為。
「啱啦，因為佢係相信自己嘅行為，所以佢會去邊？」...地獄。
「啱啦，點解呢？」

23. 但如果另一個朋友同你講：「我會去天堂，因為有兩個原因。第一，因為耶穌為我嘅罪死咗；第二，因為我係個好人。」咁你覺得佢會去天堂定地獄？
地獄。
如果佢話天堂，問：「如果佢係靠兩樣嘢，咁其實佢就唔係100%信靠耶穌，而係50%靠耶穌，50%靠自己嘅行為。咁如果耶穌只係負責一半，佢會去邊？」...地獄。
「所以我哋一定要單單相信耶穌係唯一嘅原因，而唔係靠自己嘅行為。明唔明呀？」

24. 咁喺 0-100% 嘅比例入面，你有幾肯定自己死咗會去天堂？
100%。
如果佢話少過100%，問：「咁頭先講過係咩原因令你可以入天堂㗎？」...耶穌。
「啱啦，咁耶穌係幫你支付咗幾多懲罰？」...所有。
「咁仲有幾多懲罰係要留低俾你去地獄承擔㗎？」...冇咗。
「咁如果你相信呢樣嘢，咁喺 0-100% 嘅比例入面，你可以有幾肯定會去天堂？」...100%。

如果佢仲係唔肯定，問佢咩原因令佢唔夠100%肯定，然後幫佢解釋問題，提醒佢耶穌已經為佢嘅過去、現在同未來嘅罪支付咗代價。

25. 咁做好事係咪同入天堂有關係？
冇關係。
如果佢話有，問：「咁係我哋做好事拯救咗我哋，定係耶穌死喺十字架拯救咗我哋？」如果需要，可以用問題 10嘅做好事比喻再解釋。

26. 咁我哋需唔需要求原諒先可以入天堂？
唔需要。
如果佢話需要，問：「咁係因為求原諒拯救咗我哋，定係耶穌死喺十字架拯救咗我哋？」如果需要，可以用問題 10嘅做好事比喻再解釋。

27. 咁我哋需唔需要受洗先可以入天堂？
唔需要。
如果佢話需要，問：「咁係因為受洗拯救咗我哋，定係耶穌死喺十字架拯救咗我哋？」

28. 如果做好事同入天堂冇關係，咁我哋點解要做好事呢？
因為感激。
如果佢唔識答，你可以話：「如果你喺火場入面，消防員冒住生命危險救咗你出嚟，咁你會想點樣回報佢呀？」【等佢答】
「啱啦，你一定唔會想打佢一拳，係咪？同樣道理，耶穌為咗救我哋免受地獄嘅火，犧牲咗祂自己，咁你會點樣回應耶穌呢？」

“If you’re unconscious in the fire, you’re relying on the fireman to do all the work as you can’t help him
at all because you’re unconscious, Same for Jesus, we are dead in our sins and can’t assist Jesus in
saving us from the eternal Hell fire, He does all the work by dying on the cross for our sins, make
sense?”
And because we are thankful to Jesus for what he has done for us, that
motivates us now to live our lives for him and avoid sinning. Does that make
sense?
We don't stop our sins and do good things for Jesus to save us, we do good
things for him and desire to live better because he HAS saved us. Make sense?
Yes..
29. Do you know how you can find out more about Jesus?
The Bible
30. Yep! Do you have a bible and do you read it much?
If they say No, you can share a link with them to get one.
31. Think of it like this, If you ate food only once a week, would you be very
strong?
no..
Right. We eat food everyday to stay strong physically. Our bible is like our
spiritual food.
32. So if the bible is our spiritual food, how often do you think you should read
the bible then to be strong spiritually?
Everyday..
34. Do you go to church?... what kind of church is it?
Yes..
If they answer no, then say “Church is where you'll be able to hear God's word being preached and
where you'll meet other Christians who can help you in your faith. Does that sound good?”
Here's a link you can use to find a great church in your area (send church link)
35. Do they teach the same message we’ve spoken about here to be saved from
our sins?
If they answer yes, then that’s great. If they answer not really. Ask “So do you think it's a good
idea to keep attending a church that teaches the wrong way to heaven?”
Ask if they are able to get to another church on their own but if they can’t, Suggest the following:
- Spend time in personal prayer and reading the Bible to strengthen your faith on your own.
- Think about who you could share the gospel with at your church, because you want them to be
saved.
- Make sure to check anything you are hearing at church, with the Bible.
- Don't be bowing down to any statues/pictures or praying to anyone other than God.
- Listen in to some good preachers online, such as Alistair Begg (search his name on YouTube).
36. Also, think of your family and friends, if you asked them, "What's the reason
you'll go to heaven?" what would their answer be?
I’m not sure.. or they may say they’ll go to heaven because of Jesus..
If they answer with doing good deeds gets them to heaven then ask: “So where would they end
up?”(Hell) Refer to good deeds analogy in Q10 if needed.
37. And since you don't want them to go to hell, how could you help them not
to end up there?
Tell them about the Gospel..
38. So let me ask you, What if God asked you this "Why should I not send you to
hell for all the sins you've done", how would you answer?
should be the same answer as for Q22. If it's not the same answer as Q22 you may need to refer
to analogies again in Q10.
39. Now, remember at the beginning of this chat, what DID you think was
getting you to heaven?
Doing good/asking for forgiveness etc.
If they answer with "Because Jesus died for my sins", you may need to remind them at the start they
weren't pointing to their actions (if they were) and ask them to remind you of why we get to heaven
again.
So, since you were trusting in yourself to get you to heaven, if you had died
before this chat, where would you have ended up?
Hell..
If they say heaven, ask them “But what should we be trusting in as the ONLY reason we go to heaven?”
…Jesus. “So, you weren't trusting in Jesus but in your own actions and by trusting in your own actions
where would you have gone?”... hell
39. But if you died right now, where will you end up?
Heaven..
If they still think hell, then ask them why and see what they are still trusting in to get them to heaven..

Helpful Tips
HOW TO PRAY
The only instruction we ae given in scripture is to pray to the Father, in the name of Jesus through the
power of the Holy Spirit.
LEAD TO THE TRUTH
You can't convert or save anyone, Only God can... We can lead a person to the truth but sadly we can't
make them believe it. If they don't believe Jesus paid for their sins, then they will be paying for them
themselves in hell. Just keep them in prayer that God can soften their heart.
WHO CREATED GOD
God wasn't created, he's always been there. If you agree that time and space had a beginning, then
something outside of time had to create it as we know that things just can't create themselves. If 
something is outside of time, then that something has to be timeless. If something is timeless, they have
no beginning, they have no end, they have always been there from eternal past to eternal future.
Gift Analogy:
If someone isn’t understanding that works are required to be saved. Point out that heaven is a gift
(Romans 6:23) and then use this example:
If I said "I'll give you a gift of $20 if you wash my car". Is that $20 really a gift? {wait for their answer} If
you have to wash my car to get the $20 it wouldn't be a free gift.
Same with Jesus, he doesn't say "I'll die for you if you do good things" - because that wouldn't be a free
gift. He says "I'll die for you as a gift", you simply just need to accept that gift by trusting he died for you.
So do you have to do good things to go to heaven then?
If the person is still struggling with trusting in works:
Can I ask you, out of 100, how much of the work needed to get you to heaven did Jesus for you?
Right, so how much work is left over for you to do to go to heaven?
So that is why good works aren't required for us to go to heaven. Jesus gives us heaven as a free gift, we
just need to accept his gift by trusting he's already done all the work for us in paying for our sins. Does
that make sense?
$1M Gift analogy:
If a person stood at the front of your house and had a free gift of $1m in a briefcase with a sign "Free
Gift" above his head, you have 2 options, you can either accept it or reject it.
If you choose to accept it then in response to that amazing generosity you may be then inclined to do
good things for the person in return as a sign of Gratitude. But the good things you do in return aren't
needed to receive the gift, you're doing for them as you're grateful.
But, just because you're "aware" he stands there with a gift of $1M doesn't mean you've received it.
Same for Jesus, He offers a free gift for us to either accept or reject and as for the above, we would now
want to do good things in return to show our gratitude but just because I'm aware that He died for my
sins, doesn't mean I've accepted His Gift.
The new inclination for wanting to do good works now would be as a result of me having received His
amazing gift. If a person still "loves' their sin and doesn't show any change would be an indicator that
they're only "aware" of what Jesus has done instead of accepting "what" Jesus has done.
